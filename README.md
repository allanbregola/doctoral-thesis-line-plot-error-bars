# Line Plot with Error Bars for Doctoral Thesis (Prism GraphPad)

This repository documents a small collaborative project where I assisted a **PhD student** and **Physiotherapist** from my organisation in creating a high-quality **line plot with error bars** using **Prism GraphPad** for inclusion in her doctoral thesis.

---

## Context

- The PhD student required a clear and accurate visualisation of longitudinal data for her thesis.
- The goal was to produce a **line plot** with correctly formatted **error bars**, ready for publication and inclusion in the thesis document.
- I provided guidance on:
  - Data structuring for Prism
  - Correct choice of graph type
  - Formatting options (line styles, markers, colours, fonts)
  - Presentation of **mean and 95%CI** 

---

## Outcome

- Successfully generated a professional, publication-quality line plot with error bars.
- The student incorporated the graph into her thesis.
- I provided supporting documentation to help her replicate the process for future figures.

## Example

An example of the type of graph produced is included in [`example_graph/line_plot_example.png`](example_graph/line_plot_example.png). (this is a fake data, the original data will be presented in her thesis)

---

## Notes

- The workflow is documented in [`notes/how_to_create_in_prism.md`](notes/how_to_create_in_prism.md).
- Example data structure is provided in [`data_example/example_data.csv`](data_example/example_data.csv).

## Why share this?

- To demonstrate collaborative work in **scientific data visualisation**.
- To provide a practical example of supporting **colleagues from different disciplines** in using data visualisation tools.
- To document transferable skills relevant to **clinical research**, **academic writing**, and **scientific communication**.
